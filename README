Basic functionality of what will eventually be a quad-rotor drone. Runs on an
8-bit AVR Atmega48, connected to a mems gyroscope, acclerometer and digital
compass. The AVR reads data from each of the sensors over I2C, and integrates
it to obtain position and orientation informations. For debugging, it can write
data back to a PC over UART. All communications are interrupt driven.

Code is all written in C, and compiled using the avr-gcc toolchain.
